## About

This is the license that I use for all my projects.
It's quite similar to the [WTFPL][], but there are some important changes.
Here is the summary:

* It's more polite.

  There's no need for cursing. It also gives the impression that
  I don't care about my work and how others use it. I do care.

* Offers no warranty.

  If you can do anything with my work, only you should be liable
  for it.

* It's more explicit.

  It specifies that the license terms apply to both the license itself
  and any files distributed with it. Like the WTFPL, it avoids the
  word "software", so it can be used for artwork, documentation, etc...

* Zero restrictions.

  It lifts the only restriction that the WTFPL has: it does not
  require users to change the name if they modify anything. That's
  also why this license has no particular name other than the
  generic "LICENSE" name at the top.

The full text is available in the [Documentation][] folder. To use it,
copy the License file and include it in your project.
